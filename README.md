## Project Overview

For this project, you will use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### The Data

aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

It is up to you to decide what data to use, how to deal with missing values, how to aggregate the data, and how to visualize it in an interactive dashboard.

### Key Points

making recommendations for how the business should move forward with the new aviation opportunity.

Create a storyline your audience (the head of the aviation division) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **non-technical presentation**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **GitHub repository**
* An **Interactive Dashboard**

### Non-Technical Presentation

The non-technical presentation is a slide deck presenting your analysis to business stakeholders.

* ***Non-technical*** does not mean that you should avoid mentioning the technologies or techniques that you used, it means that you should explain any mentions of these technologies and avoid assuming that your audience is already familiar with them.
* ***Business stakeholders*** means that the audience for your presentation is the business, not the class or teacher. Do not assume that they are already familiar with the specific business problem.

The presentation describes the project ***goals, data, methods, and results***. It must include at least ***three visualizations*** which correspond to ***three business recommendations***.

We recommend that you follow this structure, although the slide titles should be specific to your project:

1. Beginning
    * Overview
    * Business Understanding
2. Middle
    * Data Understanding
    * Data Analysis
3. End
    * Recommendations
    * Next Steps
    * Thank You
       * This slide should include a prompt for questions as well as your contact information (name and LinkedIn profile)

You will give a live presentation of your slides and submit them in PDF format on Canvas. The slides should also be present in the GitHub repository you submit with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.



### Jupyter Notebook



### GitHub Repository


A professional GitHub repository has:

1. `README.md`
    * A file called `README.md` at the root of the repository directory, written in Markdown; this is what is rendered when someone visits the link to your repository in the browser
    * This file contains these sections:
       * Overview
       * Business Understanding
          * Include stakeholder and key business questions
       * Data Understanding and Analysis
          * Source of data
          * Description of data
          * Three visualizations (the same visualizations presented in the slides and notebook)
       * Conclusion
          * Summary of conclusions including three relevant findings


You wil submit a link to the GitHub repository on Canvas.


### Interactive Dashboard

The interactive dashboard is a collection of views that allows the viewer to change the views to understand different features in the data. This dashboard will be linked within your GitHub repository README.md file so that users can explore your analysis. Make sure you follow visual best practices that you have learned in this course. Below is an example of what you could produce for this assignment.
